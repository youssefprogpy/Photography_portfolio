# Photography Portfolio

A modern and responsive photography portfolio website showcasing the work of **Youssef Elyoubi**, a photographer and visual storyteller based in Morocco.[1]

## Features

- Clean, responsive layout built with HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap for smooth viewing on desktop and mobile devices.[2][1]
- Smooth navigation with a fixed, semi-transparent navbar that highlights the active section while scrolling.[3][1]
- Hero “Home” section with a full-screen background image and a clear call-to-action button linking to the gallery.[1][2]
- “About” section describing the photographer’s background, journey, and approach, supported by curated images.[2][1]
- “Gallery” section displaying 9 photography works with consistent styling, hover effects, and click-to-zoom functionality for each image.[3][1][2]
- “Contact” section with a styled form that includes real-time validation for name, email, and message, enabling the submit button only when all fields are valid.[1][2][3]
- Animated footer with social media icons (Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn) and subtle hover effects.[2][1]

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5** for page structure and semantic sections.[1]
- **CSS3** with custom styling and animations for layout, typography, hover effects, and responsive design.[2]
- **Bootstrap 5** for grid system, navbar, and basic responsiveness.[1]
- **Font Awesome** for social media icons.[1]
- **JavaScript (Vanilla)** for scroll-based navbar behavior, section highlighting, image zoom overlay, and form validation.[3]

## Project Structure

- `index.html` – Main structure of the website, including Home, About, Gallery, and Contact sections.[1]
- `css/style.css` – Custom styles for layout, animations, gallery images, and the footer.[2]
- `js/main.js` – JavaScript for interactivity (scroll effects, image zoom, form validation).[3]
- `images/` – Folder containing background, about/journey images, and the 9 portfolio images displayed in the gallery.[1]

## How to Run

1. Clone or download the project folder.  
2. Make sure the `css`, `js`, and `images` folders are in the correct relative paths used in `index.html`.[1]
3. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser.  
4. Scroll through the sections, click images in the gallery to zoom, and test the contact form validation.[3][1]

## Customization

- Replace the images in the `images/` folder with your own photos while keeping the same filenames or updating the `src` paths in `index.html`.[1]
- Edit the About text and contact details in `index.html` to reflect your own bio and links.[1]
- Adjust colors, fonts, and hover effects in `css/style.css` to match your personal branding.[2]
